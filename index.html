            <p>Hello! My name is Michelle Reyes and I live in the United States but I am from Ecuador, Guayaquil. I have a passion for everything that is related to business. However, I am currently an online Software Development student at BYU Idaho. I enjoy challenges that have the potential to enhance and increase my intellectual, and critical thinking skills, which is why I decided to study Software Development. As a woman, I believe that I have the responsibility to show the world that women are smart and capable. As women, we must break those societal standards that impede us from experimenting and develop our intellectual skills in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). It is an honor for me to be part of the women in the STEM community. My favorite hobbies are reading, exercising, and spending time with my wonderful husband. </p>
